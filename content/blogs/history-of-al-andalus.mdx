Spain’s Islamic history was a cultural mix of three major religions: **Islam, Christianity, and Judaism**. Today’s modern Andalus is known for a distinctive identity and culture that reflects the architecture and culture of Spain. Spain has changed over three thousand years due to immigrants and struggles.

In the year 711, the **Iberian Peninsula**—today recognized as Spain and Portugal—was conquered and ruled by Muslim forces for over seven centuries. Muslims, known as the **Moors**, established a society named **Al-Andalus**, known for its prosperity, schools, libraries, and public baths. Al-Andalus made noteworthy contributions to European culture through its **architecture, poetry, and literature**, fostering coexistence between people of different faiths.

During the 7th century, **Islamic civilization** extended both east and west. The **Umayyads**, based in **Damascus**, expanded Islam across Israel, Syria, parts of Turkey, and North Africa. Spain became a pivotal territory for the Umayyad Caliphate’s expansion during the 7th and 8th centuries.

In **711**, **Berber tribesmen** crossed the Straits of Gibraltar and invaded Europe. With help from the **Wittizans**, Muslim forces overpowered the **Visigoth army**, defeated King Roderick, and conquered most of Spain and Portugal.

The expansion moved north toward the **Pyrenees Mountains**, but was halted at **Poitiers** by **Charles Martel**. From 711 to 756, the region remained under Umayyad control. Muslims were initially seen as **liberators from Visigothic oppression**, offering lenient surrender terms and encouraging conversion to Islam. However, efforts to create a unified Muslim state were hampered by **internal divisions and social tension**.

## Umayyad Dynasty

Under **Abd al-Rahman**, the **Emirate of Cordoba** was established in 756. Escaping the Abbasid massacre in Damascus, Abd al-Rahman fled to Iberia. In Cordoba, he introduced advanced **irrigation techniques** and trade systems. Crops like olives, lemons, palm trees, avocados, pomegranates, and artichokes flourished, making Cordoba a **cosmopolitan hub** with over **100,000 residents**, the largest settlement in Europe at the time.

With **700 mosques**, **70 libraries**, and over **3000 public baths**, Cordoba became a beacon of knowledge and culture. Homes featured **running water** and **oil lanterns**. The **Grand Mosque of Cordoba** was a massive architectural marvel with a floor space equal to four football fields and **600 marble columns**.

Cordoba had advanced **administration**, **medical services**, and a structured **legal system**. Scholars thrived in fields like **astronomy**, **mathematics**, **literature**, and **architecture**. Religious minorities, including Christians and Jews, were treated with **relative tolerance**.

In **929**, Abd al-Rahman declared himself **Caliph**, elevating Cordoba’s position in the Islamic world. The city rivaled **Baghdad** in prominence and spurred architectural innovation across Al-Andalus. Yet, internal power struggles and the use of foreign mercenaries led to the rise of competing **Muslim states**, signaling fragmentation in Al-Andalus.

## The Reconquista

The **Reconquista** was a series of Christian military campaigns that led to the fall of Islamic rule in Iberia. In the **11th century**, Christians reclaimed **Toledo**, prompting a response from **General Yusuf Bin Tashfin** of the **Almoravid** forces, who defeated the Christians and restored control of Al-Andalus.

The **Almoravids** imposed a strict **fundamentalist regime** from Marrakesh, aiming to "purify" society. However, tensions arose as the state was caught between **Christian aggression** and **internal dissent**. By **1144–1145**, rebellions fractured Islamic unity, and **independent states** emerged, weakening Muslim defense against Catholic forces.

The **Almohads**, succeeding the Almoravids, took a more **intolerant stance**—forcing **Christians and Jews to convert** or leave. Their decline began after defeat by **Alfonso VIII of Castile** in **1195**, leading to a **papal crusade** initiated by **Celestine III** and reaffirmed by **Innocent III** in 1206.

In **1212**, a coalition from Italy, France, Aragon, and Castile defeated the Almohads at the **Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa**. Cities like **Murcia**, **Merida**, **Valencia**, **Badajoz**, and **Seville** fell by **1248**. Only **Granada** remained under Muslim rule by 1250.

Granada endured numerous sieges for over two centuries. But on **January 1, 1492**, the Catholic monarchs captured it, marking the **end of Islamic rule in Spain**.

## Post Reconquista Era

After the **Reconquista**, Spain shifted to **religious intolerance**. In **1492 and 1502**, Muslims were forced to **convert to Catholicism** or face expulsion. Many Arabic manuscripts were destroyed, and Islamic practices were outlawed.

By **1567**, **King Philip II** banned the **Arabic language** and Islamic rituals. In **1609**, Spain ordered the **expulsion of all Muslims**, displacing around **250,000 people** to **North Africa**.

Despite this, the **Moorish legacy** remains in Spain. The **culinary flavors**, **architectural wonders**, and cultural traces in **Cordoba**, **Giralda**, and the **Alhambra Palace** continue to reflect the rich Islamic history of **Al-Andalus**.
