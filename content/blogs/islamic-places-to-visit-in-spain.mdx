Spain is a culturally diverse European country located in the southwest and occupies around 85% of the Iberian Peninsula, shared with Portugal. Different cultures have built up Spain like **Catalonians, Castilians, Galicians, Basques, Lusitanians, Arabs, and Jews**. Islamic Spain had a mixed population of the three greatest monotheistic religions: **Christians, Jews, and Muslims**. During the Muslim era, all three lived together—though **Christians and Jews lived under certain restrictions**.

The **Islamic history of Spain** began in **711 AD** with the Muslim invasion of the Iberian Peninsula, which was conquered within seven years. The **Umayyad Caliphate of Cordoba** in the 10th century became one of the greatest Muslim civilizations. Muslim rule formally ended in **1492** with the fall of **Granada**.

The heart of Muslim Spain was **Andalusia (Southern Spain)**. The Muslim period stretched from **711 to 1492**. Notable Islamic cities to visit include **Cordoba, Seville, Granada, Toledo, and Madrid**. **Cordoba** was the historic capital, and **Granada** was the last stronghold of Muslim rule.
