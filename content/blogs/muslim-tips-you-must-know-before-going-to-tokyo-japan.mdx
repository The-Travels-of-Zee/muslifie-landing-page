If you have planned your next vacation to Tokyo, you must be looking forward to having an amazing vacation, but at the same time, it is normal to have concerns regarding the availability of Muslim services in Tokyo. Well, you no longer have to think about it because this blog will have all the answers to your questions. Before you head to Tokyo, you must know some general Muslim tips and information to make your journey smooth and hassle-free. Japan itself does not have a significant Muslim population. Still, with Muslim tourists visiting Japan increasing over the years, it is now possible to find Halal food and prayer facilities in Tokyo. The best part about visiting Japan is that it is diverse and open-minded towards other religions. With time, the number of Halal-certified restaurants, prayer rooms, and other Muslim services is increasing to facilitate Muslim travelers.

## Muslim Friendly Accommodations

The first thing you look for before traveling to a place is accommodation, luckily, some hotels in Tokyo are Muslim-friendly. This includes halal food, prayer mats, and qibla direction facilities. Also, some hotels that do not offer Halal food on their menu do have some Halal food restaurants in their vicinity. If you are looking for the perfect hotel to stay in Tokyo, it is recommended to search in the area near larger mosques. These areas have Halal food restaurants and halal shops nearby. Staying in a Muslim-friendly neighborhood automatically makes it a lot easier to find halal food and prayer facilities.

## Halal Food

With the increasing numbers of Muslim tourists arriving in Tokyo, finding restaurants serving Halal food is possible. Although restaurants that claim to serve Halal food also serve alcohol, you can make prior reservations at the restaurant to request Halal meals. Also, you can find Indian, Turkish, Malaysian, and Pakistani restaurants serving halal food. It should better be noted that the restaurants that serve Halal food also cook non-halal food in the same kitchen, which might be disturbing for some people. Therefore, it is safe to stay at an Airbnb or room with a kitchen so that you can cook your meals on your own without worrying about the authenticity of the halal food. Not all supermarkets will have halal ingredients, but some grocery stores do provide Indian and other halal ingredients.

Finding prayer rooms and mosques in famous cities of Japan like Tokyo is not a challenge anymore. With the increasing number of Muslim tourists, Japan has facilitated Muslim tourists by accommodating them with the necessary religious services, including signage to guide them to the prayer rooms at the airport, hotels, and some public places. Although you can easily avail prayer facilities in the city, it is advised to carry a prayer mat with you at all times. Also, there is a specific mobile app that directs you to the right Qibla direction, having access to the mobile app with an available internet connection will allow you to offer your prayers anywhere.

## Halal Tours

The best way to spend a hassle-free trip to Tokyo is by joining a Muslim-friendly tour guide. These tours are purposely created for Muslim tourists to help them visit the historical and must-see sites of the city. They also cater to their guests by guiding them about halal food, prayer rooms, and the right Qibla directions. Also, if you join any Halal tour guide, this will, in turn, help you connect with Muslim tourists from different parts of the world to offer a diversified traveling experience.
