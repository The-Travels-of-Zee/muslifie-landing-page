# Top Halal Friendly Accommodations in Venice

For many tourists, Venice is a magical city built on 118 islands, connected by over 400 bridges. Its canals, gondolas, and centuries-old architecture make it one of the world’s most unique destinations. With no cars and everything done by foot or boat, Venice offers an experience like no other—accompanied by the gentle splash of canal water as you stroll its alleyways.

Must-visits include **St. Mark’s Square**, **St. Mark’s Bell Tower**, **Gallerie dell’Accademia**, **Doge’s Palace**, **the Grand Canal**, **Burano Island**, **the Jewish Ghetto**, and the **Peggy Guggenheim Museum**.

To help Muslim travelers explore Venice more comfortably, here are five halal-friendly accommodations offering access to halal food, mosques, and central locations.
